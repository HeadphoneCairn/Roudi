Command bytes always start with a 1, so >= 80 (80 - FF), and are also called Status bytes
Data bytes always start with a 0, so <80 (00 - 7F)
So only 7 bits available for the real data = 0..127

Channel is in second nibble of comands 8.-E.
Channel in command is 0..15, but is called 1 to 16 in real life

Remarks:
- Note on with velocity 00 is the same as note off.
- Oppassen voor te weinig ontvangen data bytes voor een commando! Moet typisch ge-ignored worden.
- Oppassen voor RUNNING STATUS = te veel bytes voor een commando:
  command byte + data bytes + data bytes + data bytes 
  bvb: channel aftertouch
       notes on (en on met velocity=00)
- Oppassen voor System Real Time
   They can be inserted into the MIDI data stream at any time, even in the
   middle of another message, and they can even pop up in the middle of Running Status without
   interrupting it (i.e., they are not interpreted as new Command bytes).
- MSB = most significant byte, LSB = least significant byte
- Modes:
  - Omni on (CC 7D): device respond to all channels,
    Omni off (CC 7C): responds to one channel (or a selection of channels in case of multitrimmbality)
  - Poly (CC 7F): device responds to multiple notes polyphonically (like a chord), 
    Mono (CC 7E): respond to one note at a time
